This is the crystal-analytics iOS Framework.

Written in Objective-C, this framework was intended to run on watchOS 1.0 and provide very simple and very lightweight app analytics, talking to the crystal-analytics API (a Node.js web app).

Crystal Analytics was a pipe dream project to be the first analytics framework for Apple Watch. It never got enough momentum quickly enough, and as such bigger players like Flurry Analytics launched their Apple Watch offerings before this could ever have became a reality.

Open sourced just for the sake of it.
